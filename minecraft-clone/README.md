# Minecraft Clone

A browser-based voxel "Minecraft-style" game built with Three.js. 100% client-side
static — no backend, no API calls; all state lives in the browser. Served from
GitHub Pages at <https://wilbergr.github.io/minecraft-clone/>.

**Status: Phase 2 of ~7** — procedural chunked voxel terrain with block
breaking/placing. Inventory, combat, save/load, and the treasure hunt land in
subsequent PRs.

## Run locally

```bash
cd minecraft-clone
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173/minecraft-clone/
```

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Click | Capture the mouse (pointer lock) |
| Mouse | Look around |
| `W` `A` `S` `D` / arrow keys | Move |
| `Shift` | Sprint |
| Left click | Break the targeted block |
| Right click | Place the selected block on the targeted face |
| `1`–`4` | Select block to place (grass / dirt / stone / sand) |
| `Esc` | Release the mouse |

## Build & deploy

```bash
npm run build      # produces dist/ with base '/minecraft-clone/'
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
npm run deploy     # build + publish dist/ to gh-pages under /minecraft-clone/
```

Deployment uses the repo-wide `gh-pages --add` convention so publishing this app
preserves the other apps on the Pages branch. From the repo root,
`npm run deploy:minecraft` does the same thing.

## World architecture (Phase 2)

- **Terrain** is a deterministic function of `WORLD.seed` (see `config.js`):
  a vendored seeded 2D simplex noise (`world/noise.js`) run through 4-octave
  FBM gives each column a surface height; layers assign block types (grass on
  top, dirt below, stone deeper, sand on low "beach" surfaces).
- **Block types** live in the `world/blocks.js` data table (id, name, solid,
  per-face colors). Later phases extend entries with hardness/drops.
- **Chunks** (`world/Chunk.js`) are 16×16×48 `Uint8Array` columns, each meshed
  face-culled into a single `BufferGeometry` with vertex colors — one draw
  call per chunk, hidden faces never emitted. `World.update()` streams chunks
  in around the player (nearest first, budgeted per frame) out to
  `WORLD.renderDistance` and unloads them again as the player moves on.
- **Edits** go through `World.setBlock()`, which records them in an overlay
  map (so they survive chunk unload/reload within a session), updates the
  chunk, and remeshes it plus any bordering chunk. In-browser persistence
  (localStorage save/load) is a later phase.
- **Targeting** uses a voxel grid raycast (Amanatides & Woo) over block data —
  no mesh intersection tests. `player/BlockInteraction.js` owns break/place
  and the `selectedBlockId` seam that Phase 3's inventory/hotbar will drive.

## Treasure hunt & `TREASURE_MESSAGE`

The treasure-hunt system arrives in a later phase, but its config seam exists
now: `src/config.js` exports a `TREASURE_MESSAGE` constant at the top of the
file. That string is the final message revealed when the treasure hunt is
completed — edit it there to personalize the reveal. Clue placement and
discovery logic will live in `src/treasure/`.

## Later phases (separate PRs)

- Inventory + hotbar (persisted to `localStorage`)
- Combat / mobs
- Treasure hunt with clues and the final `TREASURE_MESSAGE` reveal
- Polish: sounds, settings, performance tuning
